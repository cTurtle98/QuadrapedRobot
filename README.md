# QuadrapedRobot

an arduino program using the mePed walking algorythem but with the input changed to use a ServoShock

## Project

this is a project using a servoshock as an input from a dualshock 4 to an arduino uno using the meped walking algorythem then outputting on the pwm outputs on the servoshock

in the future I want to make the walking speed controllable (drive via joystick insetad of dpad)
